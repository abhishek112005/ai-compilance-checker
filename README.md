# Product Compliance Checker

This project provides a simple system to verify whether product images match the product description. When images are uploaded along with a description, the backend extracts text from the images using Gemini OCR. The extracted text is compared with the provided description to generate a compliance score and identify mismatches.

The system stores products, images, and compliance results, making it easy to review and validate product information. A clean interface allows adding products, viewing existing ones, and running compliance checks quickly. The goal is to help ensure accuracy and consistency in product listings before they are published on any platform.
